# dataset-of-corrosion-parameters-for-rebar-in-simulated-pore-solution-and-mortar

Overview

This dataset provides comprehensive corrosion parameter data for reinforcing steel (rebar) in simulated pore solutions and mortar. It includes detailed measurements of corrosion potential, corrosion current density, and Tafel slopes under various chloride levels and carbonation treatments. The data aims to shed light on the corrosion behavior of rebar in environments that closely mimic real-world conditions.

Data Description

The dataset encompasses a range of conditions to simulate different environmental impacts on rebar corrosion:

Chloride Levels: Includes multiple levels of chloride contamination to assess its effect on rebar corrosion.
Carbonation States: Considers different carbonation states to understand their influence on the corrosion process.
Corrosion Parameters: Focuses on key parameters like corrosion potential (E_corr), corrosion current density (i_corr), anodic Tafel slope (β_a), and cathodic Tafel slope (β_c).

Associated Publication

This dataset supports the research findings presented in the paper titled "On the Corrosion Parameters Acquired through Potentiodynamic Scans of Carbon Steel Rebar in Simulated Pore Solution and Mortar," which has been accepted for publication by the journal Construction and Building Materials. The paper elaborates on the methodology, experimental setup, and in-depth analysis of the data provided in this repository.

Accessing the Data

The dataset is publicly accessible and can be utilized for further research, academic studies, or practical applications in the field of civil engineering and materials science. Researchers and practitioners can leverage this data to enhance their understanding of rebar corrosion and develop more effective corrosion mitigation strategies.
