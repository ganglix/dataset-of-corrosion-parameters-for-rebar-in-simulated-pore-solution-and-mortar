# dataset-of-corrosion-parameters-for-rebar-in-simulated-pore-solution-and-mortar
This dataset provides data on the corrosion potential, corrosion current density and Tafel slopes of rebar in simulated pore solution and mortar with various levels of chloride and carbonation treatment. 

This dataset is made assessable for paper "On the Corrosion Parameters Acquired through Potentiodynamic Scans of Carbon Steel Rebar in Simulated Pore Solution and Mortar" accepted by Construction and Building materials
